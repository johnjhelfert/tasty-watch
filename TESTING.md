# Tasty-Watch Testing Suite

A comprehensive lightweight testing solution implemented for the Tasty-Watch application following staff engineer principles of simplicity, maintainability, and effective test coverage.

## Overview

This testing infrastructure provides three layers of coverage:
1. **Unit Tests** - Core business logic, utilities, and services
2. **Component Logic Tests** - UI component behavior without DOM complexity  
3. **End-to-End Tests** - Complete user workflows and accessibility

## Testing Stack

- **Vitest**: Fast, Vite-native test runner with TypeScript support and jsdom environment
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Enhanced DOM matchers for assertions
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: Realistic API mocking at the network level
- **Playwright**: Cross-browser E2E testing for critical user workflows
- **Component Logic Testing**: Pure TypeScript testing of component behavior

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests (`src/lib/**/*.test.ts`)
- **Utils** (`formatters.test.ts`): Price formatting, percentages, timestamps, debouncing (11 tests)
- **Services** (`api.test.ts`): API client, authentication, data fetching, error handling (7 tests)  
- **Stores** (`auth.test.ts`): Authentication state management, login/logout flows (6 tests)

### Component Logic Tests (`src/lib/components/**/*.test.ts`)
- **LoginForm** (`LoginForm.test.ts`): Authentication validation, input trimming, error handling (4 tests)
- **SymbolSearch** (`SymbolSearch.test.ts`): API integration, debouncing, keyboard navigation, result limiting (7 tests)
- **WatchlistTable** (`WatchlistTable.test.ts`): Price calculations, data formatting, sorting, symbol removal (8 tests)

### E2E Tests (`tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`)
- **Authentication** (`auth.spec.ts`): Login flows, validation, password visibility, logout (5 tests)
- **Watchlist Management** (`watchlist.spec.ts`): CRUD operations, symbol management, data display (7 tests)  
- **Accessibility** (`accessibility.spec.ts`): Keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, screen reader support (8 tests)

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit and component tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode (auto-rerun on changes)
npm run test:watch

# Run only tests in src/lib/ directory (same as 'npm run test')
npm run test:unit

# Run E2E tests (requires built application)
npm run test:e2e

# Run with coverage reporting
npm run test:coverage
```

**Note**: "Unit tests" includes both traditional unit tests (utils, services, stores) AND component logic tests. All 43 tests run together in a single command since they all use Vitest and run quickly (~1.4 seconds).

## Testing Strategy & Architecture

### Mock Data Strategy
- **MSW handlers** (`src/test-utils/handlers.ts`) provide realistic API responses
- **Component-specific mocks** in individual test files for focused testing
- **Environment-specific mocks** for localStorage, window APIs
- **Configurable responses** for error and success scenarios

### Component Testing Approach
Our component tests focus on **logic validation** rather than DOM rendering:
- âœ… **Pure TypeScript**: Test component behavior without Svelte rendering complexity
- âœ… **Fast & Reliable**: No DOM dependencies, no timing issues
- âœ… **Business Logic Focus**: Validate core functionality that matters most
- âœ… **Easy to Maintain**: Simple tests that won't break with UI changes

### Test File Organization
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/formatters.test.ts          # Pure function testing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/api.test.ts              # API client with MSW mocks  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ stores/auth.test.ts               # State management logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ auth/LoginForm.test.ts        # Authentication logic
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ symbols/SymbolSearch.test.ts  # Search behavior
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ watchlist/WatchlistTable.test.ts # Price calculations
tests/e2e/                                # Full user workflows
â””â”€â”€ src/test-utils/handlers.ts            # MSW API mocks
```

## Key Testing Decisions

### Why Logic-Focused Component Tests?
- **Svelte 5 Complexity**: Full component rendering requires complex browser environment setup
- **Better Coverage**: Tests the business logic that actually matters to users
- **Faster Feedback**: Pure TypeScript tests run in milliseconds 
- **More Stable**: Won't break when UI styling or structure changes
- **Easier Debugging**: Clear test failures point directly to logic issues

### Real-Time Features Testing
- **Unit Level**: Polling logic tested in stores and services
- **E2E Level**: UI structure verified, but not actual polling behavior  
- **Integration Level**: Would require backend for true real-time testing

## Future Enhancements

- **Visual regression testing** for UI consistency with tools like Percy or Chromatic
- **Performance testing** for quote update intervals and bundle size
- **Integration with CI/CD pipeline** for automated testing on PRs
- **Code coverage reporting** with c8 or similar tools
- **Component integration tests** using browser-based testing when Svelte 5 tooling matures
- **Mutation testing** for test effectiveness validation
